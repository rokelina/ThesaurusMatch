# Synonym Finder

This is a simple browser application that randomly selects a word from a json file `thesaurus.json` and prompts the user to enter a synonym for that word. If the user's input matches one of the synonyms for the selected word in the file, it will display a message saying "Correct!". If the user's input does not match any of the synonyms for the selected word, it will display a message saying "That word doesnâ€™t appear to be a synonym".
